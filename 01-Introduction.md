This chapter covers what tools you need for the rest of the book and some very high level overview of computing.

Tools needed:
- A computer with an x86 processor.
- Any general purpose Linux operating system.
- Basic development tools like an assembler, linker, compiler, debugger, etc.

Concludes with an overview of the three kinds of programming languages:
1. Machine Language: This is what the computer actually sees and deals with. Every command the computer sees is given as a number or sequence of numbers.
1. Assembly Language: This is the same as machine language, except the command numbers have been replaced by letter sequences which are easier to memorize. Other small things are done to make it easier as well.
1. High-Level Languages: High-Level languages are there to make the programming easier. Assembly language requires you to work with the machine itself. High-level languages allow you to describe the program in a more natural language. A single command in a high-level language usually is equivalent to several commands in an assembly language.

There are no exercises in this chapter.
